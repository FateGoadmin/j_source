/**
 * {@code Lock} implementations provide more extensive locking
 * operations than can be obtained using {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements.  they allow more flexible structuring, may have
 * quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
 * {@link condition} objects.
 *
 * <p>a lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
 * multiple threads. commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
 * shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
 * all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
 * acquired first. however, some locks may allow concurrent access to
 * a shared resource, such as the read lock of a {@link readwritelock}.
 *
 * <p>the use of {@code synchronized} methods or statements provides
 * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
 * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
 * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
 * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
 * they were acquired.
 *
 * <p>while the scoping mechanism for {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
 * and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,
 * there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
 * flexible way. for example, some algorithms for traversing
 * concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
 * &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; or &quot;chain locking&quot;: you
 * acquire the lock of node a, then node b, then release a and acquire
 * c, then release b and acquire d and so on.  implementations of the
 * {@code lock} interface enable the use of such techniques by
 * allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
 * and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
 * order.
 *
 * <p>with this increased flexibility comes additional
 * responsibility. the absence of block-structured locking removes the
 * automatic release of locks that occurs with {@code synchronized}
 * methods and statements. in most cases, the following idiom
 * should be used:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * lock l = ...;
 * l.lock();
 * try {
 *   // access the resource protected by this lock
 * } finally {
 *   l.unlock();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * when locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
 * taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
 * held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
 * lock is released when necessary.
 *
 * <p>{@code lock} implementations provide additional functionality
 * over the use of {@code synchronized} methods and statements by
 * providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock ({@link
 * #trylock()}), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
 * interrupted ({@link #lockinterruptibly}, and an attempt to acquire
 * the lock that can timeout ({@link #trylock(long, timeunit)}).
 *
 * <p>a {@code lock} class can also provide behavior and semantics
 * that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
 * such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
 * detection. if an implementation provides such specialized semantics
 * then the implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * <p>note that {@code lock} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement.
 * acquiring the
 * monitor lock of a {@code lock} instance has no specified relationship
 * with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance.
 * it is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code lock}
 * instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
 *
 * <p>except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any
 * parameter will result in a {@link nullpointerexception} being
 * thrown.
 *
 * <h3>memory synchronization</h3>
 *
 * <p>all {@code lock} implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
 * memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
 * lock, as described in
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">
 * the java language specification (17.4 memory model)</a>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a successful {@code lock} operation has the same memory
 * synchronization effects as a successful <em>lock</em> action.
 * <li>a successful {@code unlock} operation has the same
 * memory synchronization effects as a successful <em>unlock</em> action.
 * </ul>
 *
 * unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
 * locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
 * synchronization effects.
 *
 * <h3>implementation considerations</h3>
 *
 * <p>the three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
 * non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
 * characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
 * qualities.  further, the ability to interrupt the <em>ongoing</em>
 * acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given {@code lock}
 * class.  consequently, an implementation is not required to define
 * exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
 * lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
 * ongoing lock acquisition.  an implementation is required to clearly
 * document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * locking methods. it must also obey the interruption semantics as
 * defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
 * acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
 * method entry.
 *
 * <p>as interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. this is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. an implementation should document this behavior.
